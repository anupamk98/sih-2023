      <h2 class="how">MANAGING DIFFERENT KINDS OF WASTE</h2>
      <img src="how.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Managing different kinds of waste effectively is crucial for environmental sustainability and public health. Waste can be categorized broadly into organic and inorganic wastes. Here are strategies for managing each type of waste:
      </p>
      <ol style="list-style: lower-latin;">
        <li>
          <h4>Organic/Bio-degradable Waste : </h4>
          <p>
Managing organic waste, such as food scraps and yard waste, effectively is essential for reducing landfill waste, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and enriching soil through composting. Here are steps to manage organic waste at home:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style:disc;">
            <li><h4>Source Separation</h4><p>Begin by separating organic waste from non-organic waste at the source. Use separate bins or containers for organic waste in your kitchen and yard.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Composting</h4><p>Composting is an eco-friendly way to manage organic waste. You can compost various materials, including food scraps (vegetable and fruit peels, coffee grounds, eggshells), yard waste (grass clippings, leaves), and some paper products (unbleached paper towels, newspaper).Once the compost has fully decomposed into dark, crumbly soil-like material (a process that may take several months to a year), use it to enrich your garden soil. Compost is a valuable source of nutrients for plants.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Reduce Food Wastage</h4><p>To minimize the amount of organic waste generated, plan meals carefully, store food properly, and avoid overbuying perishable items.Be mindful of expiration dates and use older food items before newer ones.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Inorganic/Non Bio-degradable Waste : </h4>
          <p>
            Managing inorganic waste effectively is crucial for minimizing environmental pollution and conserving valuable resources. Inorganic waste includes non-biodegradable materials like plastics, metals, glass, and synthetic chemicals. Here are steps to manage inorganic waste responsibly:
                      </p>
                      <ul style="list-style:disc;">
                        <li><h4>Reduce Reuse and Recycle</h4><p>The first and most effective step is to reduce the generation of inorganic waste. Opt for products with minimal packaging, choose reusable items over single-use disposables, and buy in bulk to reduce packaging waste.Whenever possible, reuse items rather than discarding them. This can include repurposing containers, clothing, or furniture, and using items like glass jars for storage.Identify recyclable materials in your inorganic waste stream. Common recyclables include paper, cardboard, glass, plastics, and metals.</p></li>
                        <li><h4>Proper Disposal</h4><p>Dispose of non-recyclable inorganic waste in a responsible manner. Use designated trash bins or containers for this purpose.
                          For hazardous inorganic waste like electronics, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, and chemicals, follow local regulations for disposal. Many areas have designated collection points or events for hazardous waste.</p></li>
                        <li><h4>Education and Awarness</h4><p>Educate yourself and your community about responsible inorganic waste management. This includes understanding what can and cannot be recycled and how to dispose of hazardous waste safely.</p></li>
                      </ul>
        </li>
